26/12/2019, 19:35 - minjirekelvin: Found a way where we don't need spider...will implement next year or rather next month sounds better 😂😂

10/01/2020, 10:07 - minjirekelvin: 👍🏻
11/01/2020, 10:40 - minjirekelvin: Morning
11/01/2020, 10:40 - minjirekelvin: Any breakthrough on your side?
11/01/2020, 19:57 - Dennis Neverest: Not yes. Havent looked at it
12/01/2020, 00:46 - Dennis Neverest: I have fixed it. I just allowed the spider to do more that http 200-300 series
12/01/2020, 00:52 - minjirekelvin: The code on the repo?
12/01/2020, 00:53 - Dennis Neverest: Yeah
12/01/2020, 00:54 - minjirekelvin: I'll check it out
12/01/2020, 00:54 - minjirekelvin: Seems like nasuck sana in fixing these errors
12/01/2020, 00:56 - Dennis Neverest: Nope, i just have coded a little longer than you...soon youll be figuring out these errors easily...mazoea tu
12/01/2020, 00:57 - minjirekelvin: Alright hopefully get there soon...it's a great challenge
12/01/2020, 01:22 - minjirekelvin: I had tried the same if statement but wasn't working
12/01/2020, 01:22 - minjirekelvin: Guess I did it the wrong way
12/01/2020, 01:25 - minjirekelvin: Was thinking instead of using the specific codes like 500, we can use the in built array "retry_http_codes" for scrapy
12/01/2020, 01:30 - Dennis Neverest: Nice idea...try it see if it works
12/01/2020, 01:31 - minjirekelvin: Sure
12/01/2020, 01:31 - Dennis Neverest: And sleep..lol
12/01/2020, 01:31 - minjirekelvin: 😂😂 of course I will

12/01/2020, 15:36 - minjirekelvin: Updated the serial selector
12/01/2020, 15:36 - minjirekelvin: Afternoon
